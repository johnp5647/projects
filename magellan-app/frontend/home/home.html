				<h3>Mount Everest to be declared off-limits to inexperienced climbers, says Nepal</h3>

				<br>
				<p class="pic-sub">Nepalese officials plan to introduce ban on novices, as well as disabled, old and very young people, in effort to improve safety and lessen overcrowding</p>
				<br>
				<p class='story-body'>Nepalese officials say they will introduce regulations banning inexperienced climbers from attempting Mount Everest in an attempt to improve safety and maintain the “glory” of the summit.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="story-body">Kripasur Sherpa, the country’s tourism minister, said he hoped to implement the rules in time for the spring season, which usually sees hundreds of mountaineers from across the world attempt to reach the 29,029ft (8,848 metres) summit of the world’s highest peak. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="story-body">Permits to climb Everest will only be given to those who can prove they have already scaled mountains that are higher than 6,500 metres, officials said. Disabled, old and very young people also face bans. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/mount-everest-to-be-declared-off-limits-to-inexperienced-climbers">Read More</a></p>

				<h3>THE LAST GREAT ADVENTURE</h3>

				<p class="pic-sub">New documentary shows explorers Eric Larsen and Ryan Waters making what could be the last full expedition to the North Pole</p>
				<br>
				<p class="story-body">When it comes to exploration, humans are obsessed with being first — just look at the past century: Robert Peary planted the American flag at the North Pole in 1909 after scores of others died trying; Roald Amundsen became the first person to reach the South Pole in 1911 (Robert Scott, who was racing Amundsen, starved to death after discovering Amundsen had beaten him to the pole by 33 days); Edmund Hilary raced Charles Evans and Tom Bourdillon to the peak of Mount Everest in 1953 (both Evans and Bourdillon turned back); Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth in 1961, essentially strapped into a tin can mounted on a three-stage rocket; the team of Apollo 11 faced unimaginable risks to land on the moon in 1969.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="story-body">We will do anything — risk everything — to be first.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="story-body">Boulder resident and polar adventurer Eric Larsen has had his share of firsts. He was the first person to complete expeditions to the North Pole, South Pole and Mount Everest in a 365-day period. He was also part of a team that accomplished the first summer expedition to the North Pole. In 2012, Larsen attempted to be the first person to reach the South Pole by bike, but dangerous conditions forced him to turn around after 175 miles. (Daniel P. Burton became the first person to bike to the southernmost point on Earth in 2014.) <a href="http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-15322-the-last-great-adventure.html">Read More</a></p>
